# XRF_mapping_txt_h5

This MATLAB code is used to convert the raw data of SSRF BL13U 2D XRF mapping to a single .h5 file that can be read by PyMCA.

The raw data is stored in the "FullWaveForm" folder as .txt files with the format "x(row)_xxx(column).txt".

Intensity correction is achieved using the D1.txt in the parent directory.

Run the code in the "FullWaveForm" folder.
